# Book_Manager_app
This is a simple Spring boot 3 project where i'm discovering the framework and its options as a simple web application.

### Content Overview 
This project contains the down below points :
* Spring JPA Entities (Book, Author, Publisher) with their relationships.
* Hibernate
* Spring DATA Repositories for their corresponding Entities.
* H2 Database configuration as an inMemory Database.
* Spring MVC for a simple MVC patern implementation (using a BookController, a BookService and its implementation).
* A simple Thymeleaf template to showcase the H2 databse content.
